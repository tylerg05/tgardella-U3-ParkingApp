The collection type I used was ArrayLists. Since array lists are easier to use with objects, such as the Ticket, it made logical sense to use it. They were also important for storing information about the tickets such as the fee and check in/out times. Without array lists, it would be a lot harder to access information from the tickets, as well as to organize the ticket information that was written to the file.
